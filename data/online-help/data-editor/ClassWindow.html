<h3><a name="ObjectCreation"></a>Object Creation</h3>
Before creation of a new object it is necessary to decide which data
file it goes to. A data file can be made active using the <a
 href="MainWindow.html#DataFilesTable">Data Files Table from main window</a>.
To create a new object it is enough select <b>[New]</b> menu item. The
<a href="ObjectCreation.html">object creation prompt dialog</a> that
will
appear. Note, the <b>[New]</b> menu item
remains disabled, if no active file is selected.<br>
<h3><a name="ShowObject"></a>Show Object Window<br>
</h3>
An object can be selected and removed directly from the class table
(see below). Also, most of the values of it's attributes and
relationships can be seen directly in the class table. However their
modification and several other actions with object can only be done
from the <a href="ObjectWindow.html">Object window</a>. To open the
window select <b>[Show <i>object_id</i>]</b> from popup menu
or double click the object row.<br>
<h3><a name="Find"></a>Find Objects</h3>
There are two possible ways to find and object:<br>
<ul>
  <li>by object unique ID</li>
  <li>by query (e.g. by values of object attributes and it's relations
with other objects)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Find by Identity</h4>
To find an object by ID one can to use <b>[Find by ID]</b> function
from popup menu. In such case put exact UID in
the prompt dialog. If object with such ID exists in the class, it will
be selected in the class table.<br>
<br>
Also it is possible to use matching UID panel from the bottom of the
class window. If there are no any symbols in the "Matching UIDs:" text
filed, then all objects are shown. Otherwise only those objects, which
IDs match the search mask are shown.<br>
<br>
If the "Regular expression" toggle button is selected, to apply the
mask press appeared <img style="width: 24px; height: 24px;"
 alt="Search Button" src="search.gif">
button. Otherwise the modified selection is applied automatically, when
the mask is modified.<br>
<h4>Query</h4>
A query can be constructed and executed in the <a
 href="QueryWindow.html">query window</a>. Select <b>[Query]</b> item
from popup menu to
create new query or select [Load Query] to load an existing query from
file.<br>
<h2><a name="Delete"></a>Delete Object</h2>
To delete an existing object it is necessary to select it and choose <b>[Delete]</b>
menu item. An object can
only be deleted, if it is not referenced by other objects and the user
has write permissions on file containing the object. In case of
problems the error is printed to the <a href="MessageLogWindow.html">message
log window</a>.<br>
